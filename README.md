Hi there! Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am Ahmad, an Associate Data Scientist at Cognizant Technology Solutions, stationed in Hyderabad, India. My enthusiasm lies in machine learning, data science, and unveiling insights from data to drive informed decisions. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on enhancing ML and NLP applications at Cognizant, while also dabbling in some personal projects involving deep learning and computer vision.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m on a continuous learning pathway, currently delving deeper into deep learning technologies and Azure Databricks.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on machine learning and data science projects. I am particularly interested in projects that address real-world problems and have a positive impact.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about machine learning, data preprocessing, model deployment or anything related to data science. I'm here to help!
- ðŸ“« Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-iiitk/) or drop me a message on my [Telegram](https://t.me/peacefuldata).

In my journey so far, I've honed my skills in various programming languages and tools such as Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Azure, to name a few. My professional experience ranges from creating interactive data dashboards to designing efficient deep learning models. When I step away from the data, you'll find me indulging in continuous learning or assisting the community in unraveling the beauty of data science.
